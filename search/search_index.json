The growth in \u201cbig data\u201d (characterised by high volumes, variety, and velocity of new data assets) together with the availability of low-cost storage and cloud-scale distributed compute technologies has led to an alternative approach to analytical data storage; the data lake. In a data lake, data is stored as files without imposing a fixed schema for storage. Increasingly, data engineers and analysts seek to benefit from the best features of both of these approaches by combining them in a data lakehouse; in which data is stored in files in a data lake and a relational schema is applied to them as a metadata layer so that they can be queried using traditional SQL semantics.</p> <p>In Microsoft Fabric, a lakehouse provides highly scalable file storage in a OneLake store (built on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2) with a metastore for relational objects such as tables and views based on the open source Delta Lake table format. Delta Lake enables you to define a schema of tables in your lakehouse that you can query using SQL.</p> <p>This lab takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.</p> <p>For this lab you need to navigate to QA Platform and login using the credentials provided</p> <p>It is important that you use an incognito/private mode browser tab and not your work or personal Microsoft login</p>"},{"location":"01-lakehouse/#overview","title":"Overview","text":""},{"location":"01-lakehouse/#step-1-signing-in-to-microsoft-fabric","title":"Step 1: Signing in to Microsoft Fabric","text":"<p>Sign in to Microsoft Fabric using the email and password from the QA Platform.</p>"},{"location":"01-lakehouse/#step-2-create-a-workspace","title":"Step 2: Create a workspace","text":"<p>Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace.</p>"},{"location":"01-lakehouse/#step-3-create-a-lakehouse","title":"Step 3: Create a lakehouse","text":"<p>Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a data lakehouse into which you'll ingest data.</p>"},{"location":"01-lakehouse/#step-4-upload-a-file","title":"Step 4: Upload a file","text":"<p>Fabric provides multiple ways to load data into the lakehouse, including built-in support for pipelines that copy data from external sources and data flows (Gen 2) that you can define using visual tools based on Power Query.
