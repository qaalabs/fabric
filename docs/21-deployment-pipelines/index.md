# Lab 

Deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric let you automate the process of copying   changes made to the content in Fabric items between environments like development, test, and production. You can use deployment pipelines to develop and test content before it reaches end users. In this exercise, you create a deployment pipeline, and assign stages to the pipeline. Then you create some content in a development workspace and use deployment pipelines to deploy it between the Development, Test and Production pipeline stages.

This lab takes approximately **20** minutes to complete.
