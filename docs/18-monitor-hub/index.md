# Lab 18 - Monitor Fabric Activity in the Monitoring Hub

The monitoring hub in Microsoft Fabric provides a central place where you can monitor activity. You can use the monitoring hub to review events related to items you have permission to view.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Overview

### Step 1: Signing in to Microsoft Fabric

In this lab, you will sign in to Microsoft Fabric using the email and password from the QA Platform.

### Step 2: Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

### Step 3: Create a lakehouse

Now that you have a workspace, it’s time to create a data lakehouse for your data.

### Step 4: Create and monitor a Dataflow

In Microsoft Fabric, you can use a Dataflow (Gen2) to ingest data from a wide range of sources. In this exercise, you’ll use a dataflow to get data from a CSV file and load it into a table in your lakehouse.

### Step 5: Create and monitor a Spark notebook

In Microsoft Fabric, you can use notebooks to run Spark code.

### Step 6: Monitor history for an item

Some items in a workspace might be run multiple times. You can use the monitoring hub to view their run history.

### Step 7: Customize monitoring hub views

In this exercise you’ve only run a few activities, so it should be fairly easy to find events in the monitoring hub. However, in a real environment you may need to search through a large number of events. Using filters and other view customizations can make this easier.

## Clean up resources

In this exercise, you have created a lakehouse, a dataflow, and a Spark notebook; and you’ve used the monitoring hub to view item activity.

If you’ve finished exploring your lakehouse, you can delete the workspace you created for this exercise.
