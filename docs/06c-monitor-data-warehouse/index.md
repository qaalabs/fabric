# Lab 06c - Monitor a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

In Microsoft Fabric, a data warehouse provides a relational database for large-scale analytics. Data warehouses in Microsoft Fabric include dynamic management views that you can use to monitor activity and queries.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Overview

### Step 1: Signing in to Microsoft Fabric

In this lab, you will sign in to Microsoft Fabric using the email and password from the QA Platform.

### Step 2: Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

### Step 3: Create a sample data warehouse

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a data warehouse.

### Step 4: Explore dynamic management views

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses include *dynamic management views* (DMVs), which you can use to identify current activity in the data warehouse instance.

### Step 5: Explore query insights

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses provide *query insights* - a special set of views that provide details about the queries being run in your data warehouse.

*Initially you may see no data, this is because it takes a couple of minutes for query insights to populate.*

## Clean up resources

In this exercise, you have used dynamic management views and query insights to monitor activity in a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse.

If you've finished exploring your data warehouse, you can delete the workspace you created for this exercise.
