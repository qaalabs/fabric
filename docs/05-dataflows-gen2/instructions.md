!!! info "For this lab you need to navigate to QA Platform and login using the credentials provided"

!!! warning "It is important that you use an incognito/private mode browser tab and not your work or personal Microsoft login"

## Step 1: Signing in to Microsoft Fabric

In this lab, you will sign in to Microsoft Fabric using the email and password from the QA Platform.

1. Using an **incognito/private mode browser tab** navigate to the [Fabric portal](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/) at: https://fabric.microsoft.com

2. Follow the prompts, and sign in with the user credentials from the QA Platform:
    - Email
    - Password

3. After signing in, you will be redirected to the Fabric home page:

## Step 2: Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) in an incognito/private mode browser tab browser, and sign in with the Fabric credentials from the QA Platform.

2. In the menu bar on the left, select Workspaces (the icon looks similar to ðŸ—‡).

3. Create a **New workspace**:

    - Give it a name of your choice. For example: `fab_workspace`
    - Leave all other options as the default values
    - Click **Apply**

4. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Step 3: Create a lakehouse

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a data lakehouse into which you'll ingest data.

1. On the menu bar on the left, select **Create**. In the New page, under the *Data Engineering* section, select **Lakehouse**.
    - Give it a name of your choice. For example: `fab_lakehouse`

    !!! tip "If the **Create** option is not pinned to the sidebar, you need to select the ellipsis (â€¦) option first."

    After a minute or so, a new empty lakehouse will be created.

    !!! quote ""
        ![New lakehouse.](../img/new-lakehouse.png)

## Step 4: Create a Dataflow (Gen2) to ingest data

Now that you have a lakehouse, you need to ingest some data into it. One way to do this is to define a dataflow that encapsulates an *extract, transform, and load* (ETL) process.

1. In the home page for your lakehouse, select **Get data > New Dataflow Gen2**

    ![Lakehouse toolbar.](../img/lakehouse-toolbar.png)

    Click **Create**, and after a few seconds, the Power Query editor for your new dataflow opens as shown here:

    !!! quote ""
        ![New dataflow.](../img/05-new-dataflow.png)

2. Select **Import from a Text/CSV file**, and create a new data source with the following settings:

    - **Link to file**: *Selected*
    - **File path or URL**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/main/orders.csv
    - **Connection**: Create new connection
    - **Connection Name**: *default value* ~ or *orders.csv* if name already exists
    - **data gateway**: (none)
    - **Authentication kind**: Anonymous
    - **Privacy Level**: None

3. Select **Next** to preview the file data, and then **Create** the data source.

    The Power Query editor shows the data source and an initial set of query steps to format the data, as shown here:

    !!! quote ""
        ![Query in the Power Query editor.](../img/05-power-query.png)

## Step 5: Transform the data using Power Query

You can now transform the data. In this lab we will add a column using a custom formula.

1. On the toolbar ribbon, select the **Add column** tab. Then select **Custom column** and create a new column.

    !!! quote ""
        ![Power Query Add Column.](../img/05-power-query-add-column.png)

2. Do the following:

    - Set the *New column name* to: **MonthNo**
    - Set the *Data type* to: **Whole number**
    - Add this *Custom column formula*: `Date.Month([OrderDate])`

    !!! quote ""
        ![Custom column in Power Query editor.](../img/05-custom-column.png)

3. Click **OK** to create the column. Notice how the step to add the custom column is added to the query.

    The resulting column is displayed in the data pane:

    !!! quote ""
        ![Query with a custom column step.](../img/05-custom-column-added.png)

    !!! info
        - In the Query Settings pane on the right side, notice the **Applied Steps** include each transformation step.
        - At the bottom, you can also toggle the **Diagram view** button to turn on the Visual Diagram of the steps.

    !!! info
        Steps can be moved up or down, edited by selecting the gear icon, and you can select each step to see the transformations apply in the preview pane.

4. Check and confirm that the data type for the **OrderDate** column is set to **Date** and the data type for the newly created column **MonthNo** is set to **Whole Number**.

    !!! quote ""
        ![OrderData column type.](../img/05-order-date-column.png)

## Step 6: Add data destination for Dataflow

The next step is to define a destination for your transformed data. This will be the lakehouse you created in Step 3.

1. On the toolbar ribbon, select the **Home** tab. Then in the **Add data destination** drop-down menu, select **Lakehouse**.

    !!! note
        - If this option is grayed out, you may already have a data destination set.
        - Check the data destination at the bottom of the Query settings pane on the right side of the Power Query editor.
        - If a default destination is already set, you can remove it and add a new one.

2. In the **Connect to data destination** dialog box, use the existing connection credentials:

    !!! quote ""
        ![Data destination configuration page.](../img/qa-05-dataflow-connection.png){ width="700" }

3. Select **Next** and in the list of available workspaces, find your workspace and select the lakehouse you created in it at the start of this exercise. Then specify a new table named **orders**:

    !!! quote ""
        ![Data destination configuration page.](../img/05-data-destination-target.png)

4. Select **Next** and on the **Choose destination settings** page:

    - Disable the **Use automatic settings** option, select **Append**, and then **Save settings**.

    !!! quote ""
        ![Data destination settings page.](../img/qa-05-destination-settings.png)

5. On the Menu bar, open **View** and select **Diagram view**. Notice the **Lakehouse** destination is indicated as an icon in the query in the Power Query editor.

    !!! quote ""
        ![Query with a lakehouse destination.](../img/05-lakehouse-destination.png)

6. On the toolbar ribbon, select the **Home** tab. Then select **Save & run** and wait for the **Dataflow 1 dataflow** to be created in your workspace.

## Step 7: Add a dataflow to a pipeline

You can include a dataflow as an activity in a pipeline. Pipelines are used to orchestrate data ingestion and processing activities, enabling you to combine dataflows with other kinds of operation in a single, scheduled process. Pipelines can be created in a few different experiences, including Data Factory experience.

1. From your Fabric-enabled workspace, select **+ New item > Data pipeline**

    - When prompted, create a new pipeline named: **Load data**

    Click **Create**, and the pipeline editor will open:

    !!! quote ""
        ![Empty data pipeline.](../img/05-new-pipeline.png)

    !!! tip "If the Copy Data wizard opens automatically, you can just close it."

2. Select **Pipeline activity**, and add a **Dataflow** activity to the pipeline.

3. With the new **Dataflow1** activity selected, on the **Settings** tab, in the **Dataflow** drop-down list, select **Dataflow 1** (the data flow you created previously)

    !!! quote ""
        ![Pipeline with a dataflow activity.](../img/qa-05-dataflow-activity.png)

4. On the **Home** tab, save the pipeline using the :material-content-save: (Save) icon.

5. Use the :material-play: **Run** button to run the pipeline, and wait for it to complete. It may take a few minutes.

    !!! quote ""
        ![Pipeline with a dataflow that has completed successfully.](../img/qa-05-dataflow-pipeline-succeeded.png)

6. In the menu bar on the left edge, select your lakehouse.

7. In the **...** menu for **Tables**, select **refresh**. 

    Then expand **Tables** and select the **orders** table, which has been created by your dataflow.

    !!! quote ""
        ![Table loaded by a dataflow.](../img/qa-05-loaded-table.png)

??? tip "Tip for Power Bi Desktop users:"
    - In Power BI Desktop, you can connect directly to the data transformations done with your dataflow by using the Power BI dataflows (Legacy) connector.
    - You can also make additional transformations, publish as a new dataset, and distribute with intended audience for specialized datasets.
