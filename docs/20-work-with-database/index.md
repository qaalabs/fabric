# Lab 20 - Work with SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric

SQL database in Microsoft Fabric is a developer-friendly transactional database, based on Azure SQL Database, that allow you to easily create your operational database in Fabric. A SQL database in Fabric uses the SQL Database engine as Azure SQL Database.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Overview

### Step 1: Signing in to Microsoft Fabric

In this lab, you will sign in to Microsoft Fabric using the email and password from the QA Platform.

### Step 2: Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, you need to create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

### Step 3: Create a SQL database with sample data

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a SQL database.

### Step 4: Query a SQL database

The SQL query editor provides support for IntelliSense, code completion, syntax highlighting, client-side parsing, and validation. You can run Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL) statements.

### Step 5: Integrate data with external data sources

You will integrate an external data about public holidays with sales order. Then, you'll identify sales orders that coincide with public holidays, providing insights into how holidays might impact sales activities.

### Step 6: Secure data

Suppose a specific group of users should only have access to data from the United States to generate reports.

Let's create a view based on the query we used earlier, and add a filter to it.

## Clean up resources

If you've finished exploring your database, you can delete the workspace you created for this exercise.
