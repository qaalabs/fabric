# Lab 09 - Ingest real-time data with Eventstream in Fabric

Eventstream is a feature in Microsoft Fabric that captures, transforms, and routes real-time events to various destinations. You can add event data sources, destinations, and transformations to the eventstream.

In this exercise, you'll ingest data from a sample data source that emits a stream of events related to observations of bicycle collection points in a bike-share system in which people can rent bikes within a city.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.
